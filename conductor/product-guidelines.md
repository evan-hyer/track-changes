# Product Guidelines

## Prose Style

The prose style for all documentation and user-facing text, including CLI output messages and VS Code plugin descriptions, should be **Direct and Technical**. This approach prioritizes accuracy, conciseness, and clarity, making it suitable for experienced technical users such as Salesforce Developers and Administrators. Jargon should be used appropriately where it enhances precision, and explanations should be straightforward without unnecessary embellishment.

## Messaging Tone

The product's messaging should convey an **Empowering and Efficient** tone. This means:
-   **Empowering:** Giving users a sense of control and capability over their Salesforce metadata. The language should reflect the tool's ability to provide clear, actionable insights.
-   **Efficient:** Highlighting the tool's speed, directness, and ability to streamline workflows. Messaging should focus on how the tool saves time and effort.

Avoid overly casual or overly formal language. The tone should be professional yet supportive, emphasizing the user's ability to quickly understand and manage changes.

## Visual Identity and UI Design Principles

For the Visual Studio Code plugin and any other graphical interfaces, the guiding principles will be **Clean and Minimalist**:
-   **Clarity:** Prioritize presenting information in the most straightforward and unambiguous way possible.
-   **Simplicity:** Reduce visual clutter and unnecessary elements to improve focus on core functionalities.
-   **Ease of Use:** Design for intuitive navigation and interaction, minimizing the learning curve.
-   **Modern Aesthetics:** Utilize modern UI patterns and a clean layout to ensure a contemporary and professional appearance.

This approach ensures that the tool is not only powerful but also pleasant and easy to use, aligning with the goal of providing immediate and scannable information.

## Consistency

Consistency is **Crucial** across all components of the product, including the CLI output, documentation, and the VS Code plugin's user interface. This means:
-   **Terminology:** Use the same terms for concepts, features, and actions everywhere.
-   **Formatting:** Maintain consistent formatting for CLI tables, documentation sections, and UI elements.
-   **User Experience:** Ensure a predictable and familiar experience whether the user is interacting with the command line or the VS Code plugin.

Crucial consistency builds trust, reduces cognitive load, and enhances the overall professional perception and usability of the product.
